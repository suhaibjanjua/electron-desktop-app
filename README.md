## ‚≠ê Overview

Electron Desktop App is a meticulously crafted starter kit designed to accelerate the development of cross-platform desktop applications, featuring seamless auto-update functionality.

> Developing robust, cross-platform desktop applications can be complex, often burdened by intricate setup, platform-specific challenges, and the continuous effort of distributing updates. Ensuring users always run the latest, most secure version adds another layer of overhead.

This project provides an elegant, minimalist Electron foundation that abstracts away initial complexities. It integrates `electron-builder` for simplified packaging and, critically, enables built-in auto-update capabilities, ensuring your application remains evergreen and always up-to-date for your users.

Electron Desktop App leverages the robust Electron framework, combining a Node.js-powered main process (`main.js`) with a Chromium-based renderer process that utilizes standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for its user interface. A `preload.js` script ensures secure context isolation, while `electron-builder` handles comprehensive packaging and facilitates the integrated auto-update mechanism, enabling smooth continuous delivery.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Minimalist Electron Setup:** Provides a lean and efficient starting point for new Electron projects, focusing on simplicity and quick iteration.
*   **Cross-Platform Desktop Applications:** Develop once and deploy across Windows, macOS, and Linux with native-like experiences, leveraging Electron's inherent capabilities.
*   **Integrated Auto-Update Functionality:** Seamlessly deliver application updates to users without manual intervention, powered by the robust `electron-builder` library.
*   **Web Technologies for UI:** Build compelling and interactive user interfaces using familiar and powerful web standards: HTML (`index.html`), CSS (`styles.css`), and JavaScript (`renderer.js`).
*   **Secure Context Isolation:** Utilizes `preload.js` to enhance security by safely exposing Node.js APIs to the renderer process while maintaining context isolation.
*   **Streamlined Packaging & Distribution:** Simplifies the complex process of bundling your application into distributable packages for various operating systems, ready for deployment.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Node.js**: A recent LTS version (e.g., v18+). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm**: Node.js package manager, usually installed alongside Node.js.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Hamzaa-Amjad/electron-desktop-app.git
    cd electron-desktop-app
    ```
2.  **Install NPM dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## üîß Usage

Once installed, you can run the application in development mode or package it for distribution.

### Running in Development Mode

To start the Electron application in development mode with live reloading:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will open the Electron app window, allowing you to develop and test your changes interactively.

### Packaging the Application

To build the application for distribution across various platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux), creating a ready-to-install package:

```bash
npm run package
```

This command leverages `electron-builder` to generate platform-specific installers or executables in the `dist/` directory. These packaged applications will include the integrated auto-update functionality.
